Introduction
============

Clacket, as a project, is a movie recommendation platform. It consists of the engine (clacket), the API and web views (here), and a serverless function to orchestrate the engine and the web app functions (generate new recommendations, etc).

All the logic for the web app, separate from the recommendation engine itself, can be found in this project, Action.
